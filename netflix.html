            <h2>Netflix Clone</h2>
            <p>Users all over the world may download and watch numerous video files from the comfort of their own homes, thanks to video streaming and broadband connections. In 2009, the American business Netflix took advantage of this technology by launching a video streaming website where customers could watch the most recent television episodes and Hollywood blockbusters. And now itâ€™s there all over the world.

                So, for this project we wanted to recreate the Netflix site. Creating an exact replica of it is impossible for us, so we have chosen some of its main features and have implemented them by keeping the UI minimalistic.
                <br>
                I have used HTML and CSS for frontend design. For the back-end part we used php, Java-script and ajax and as a text-editor we used Visual Studio Code
