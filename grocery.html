            <h2>E-Commerce Grocery store</h2>
            <p>An e-commerce website, by definition, is a website that allows you to buy and sell tangible goods, digital products or services online.
                Trade, be it barter exchange or buying and selling of goods and services has been prevalent for centuries. No one can be self-sufficient. And this brings out the need for demand and supply of goods and services. 
                Online grocers are grocery stores that allow private individuals and businesses to purchase groceries and grocery products online. The companies then deliver the orders to consumers.
